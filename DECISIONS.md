# DECISIONS.md — verification log & recorded deviations

Every (verify)-marked item from the spec is resolved here with evidence.
Format: D-NNN, date, finding, evidence, consequence.

## D-001 — Advance-derivation rule amended: realm name = first 32 base58 chars of mint (2026-06-11)

**Spec said:** `realm_name := the token mint pubkey (base58)` (Section 1,
load-bearing).

**Finding:** impossible as written. A base58-encoded 32-byte pubkey is 43–44
characters; Solana PDA seeds are capped at 32 bytes per seed.
`PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from("governance"), Buffer.from(mintBase58)], GOV)`
throws `Max seed length exceeded` (verified empirically against
@solana/web3.js 1.98.4; pinned by test
`packages/sdk/test/pda.test.ts` "full base58 mint pubkey exceeds max seed length").

**Decision:** `realm_name := mintBase58.slice(0, 32)` —
`realmNameForMint()` in `packages/sdk/src/pda.ts`. Still deterministic and
computable before the mint account exists (the load-bearing property), ~187
bits of entropy so collisions are not a practical concern. **Operator
attention requested at GATE 0a sign-off.**

## D-002 — @pump-fun/pump-sdk 1.36.0 ESM build is broken; CJS entry used (2026-06-11)

**Finding:** the package's ESM output imports `@pump-fun/agent-payments-sdk`,
whose published ESM is syntactically malformed (invalid `const {X} from "..."`
constructs). Vitest/Vite resolving the `import` condition fails at collection.
The CJS build (`dist/index.js`) is intact.

**Decision:** alias `@pump-fun/pump-sdk` to its CJS entry in vitest configs
(`require.resolve`). Node script execution via tsx (CJS mode) is unaffected.
Re-check on every pump-sdk upgrade.

## D-003 — PDA seed verifications against installed package source (2026-06-11)

All pinned by `packages/sdk/test/pda.test.ts` (13 green tests, no network):

| Item | Spec claim | Verified against | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pump creator vault | `["creator-vault", creator]` (hyphen) | pump-sdk `src/pda.ts` `creatorVaultPda` | CONFIRMED |
| PumpSwap creator vault | `["creator_vault", coin_creator]` (underscore) | pump-sdk `ammCreatorVaultPda` | CONFIRMED |
| Realm | `["governance", realm_name]` | spl-governance `GOVERNANCE_PROGRAM_SEED = 'governance'` | CONFIRMED |
| Governance | `["account-governance", realm, governed_seed]` | spl-governance `withCreateGovernance.js` | CONFIRMED |
| Native treasury | `["native-treasury", governance]` | spl-governance `getNativeTreasuryAddress` (used as oracle in test) | CONFIRMED |
| VSR registrar | `["registrar", realm, community_mint]` | reference impl; to be re-verified on-chain at Stage 1 when VSR is exercised | PROVISIONAL |
| Squads vault | `getVaultPda(multisig, index)` = `["multisig", multisigPda, "vault", u8(index)]` | @sqds/multisig `lib/index.js` seeds + oracle in test | CONFIRMED |
| Pump program IDs (3) | Section 1 table | pump-sdk `src/sdk.ts` constants, asserted in test | CONFIRMED |

## D-004 — pump createV2 mints are Token-2022 (2026-06-11)

**Finding:** pump-sdk `createV2Instruction` hardcodes
`tokenProgram: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID`; `createV2AndBuyInstructions` derives
the user ATA with Token-2022 and fixes buy slippage at 1%. Downstream code
(GATE 0a script, future PumpFunRail) must use `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` for
post-create interactions with v2 mints, and `collectCreatorFeeV2` for fee
collection.

**Consequence:** GATE 0b (Token-2022 on curve) may be partially moot for v2
creates — the base path is already Token-2022. The 0b question narrows to
transfer-fee extensions specifically. Re-scope 0b when reached.

## D-005 — LaunchParams.launcher amendment (2026-06-11)

pump `create_v2` requires a `user` signer (IDL: signers are `mint` and
`user` only; `creator` is an instruction ARG, not an account). The spec's
Section 4 `LaunchParams` had no launcher field, so rails could not build the
create instruction. Added optional `launcher: PublicKey`; PumpFunRail throws
if absent. INV-1 is strengthened by this verification: the creator
structurally cannot be a signer.

## D-006 — collect_creator_fee_v2 has ZERO signer accounts (2026-06-11)

Verified from the pump IDL: every account in `collect_creator_fee_v2`
(including `creator`) is `signer: false`. INV-2 is structural at the program
level; the only tx signer is the fee-payer. Pinned by
`test/pump-rail.test.ts` "signer set is a subset of {fee-payer}".

## D-007 — Fee-sharing config creation requires creator as payer (GATE 0c risk flag) (2026-06-11)

pump-sdk `createFeeSharingConfig` sets `payer: creator`. With our PDA
creator (Squads vault), that account cannot sign a launch-ceremony tx. This
makes GATE 0c likely to FAIL as specified unless the fees program accepts a
separate payer or config-via-CPI. Flagging now so the 0c result is not a
surprise; MVP protocol revenue may be launch-fee-only, per the spec's
fallback. `buildFeeSharesAtLaunchIxs` stays gated (FeatureUnavailable).

## D-008 — Operator override: GATE 0a executed on mainnet with operator funds (2026-06-11)

The devnet faucet was IP-rate-limited in the execution environment. The
operator explicitly directed a mainnet run funded with his own USDC
(~$4.60) sent to an agent-generated disposable gas wallet
(`FMA5xzVDiEYptXfxNeS6PQtWRvrMyEy9FPLCFKMXcTds`), swapped gasless to SOL
via Jupiter Ultra (JupiterZ RFQ; sig
`5gMHW95mBXxRZ2W7VY6c737e6NpAwCXckVbEQHzh4SyBiVeERHQXx7JSCso8cVUqmYanXZtwiAFDzwMWjFcM4W1`).
This deviates from spec Section 11 ("no mainnet key is agent-generated")
for a *gas-only, disposable* key — not a revenue or upgrade key — at the
operator's explicit, repeated instruction. All liquid funds (0.0593 SOL)
were swept back to the operator wallet immediately after the run; ATAs
closed. Gate evidence in GATES.md.

## D-009 — Rent-exempt floors are a real constraint on small fund paths (2026-06-11)

Two encounters during the mainnet run:
1. 0-data system accounts (pump creator-fee vault, Squads vault PDA)
   cannot end a tx below ~890,880 lamports; tiny creator-fee transfers
   into fresh vaults would fail. Fix applied: rent pre-fund step in the
   gate script.
2. A fee payer cannot drop below the rent floor either: the buyer leg
   failed sim with "insufficient funds for rent" and was resumed with a
   smaller buy.

**Consequences for Stage 1:** the keeper (6.5) must treat
`balance - rentMin` as spendable, never `balance`; the orchestrator (6.6)
must budget rent floors for every account it touches; sweep logic must
leave rent-min in accounts that persist. Add explicit tests at the u64 and
rent boundaries (INV-6 suite).

## D-010 — VSR IDL resolved and vendored; instructions built manually (2026-06-11)

The deployed VSR (`vsr2nf...`) publishes **no on-chain anchor IDL**
(verified via `Program.fetchIdl` against mainnet). IDL obtained from
`@blockworks-foundation/voter-stake-registry-client@0.2.3` (program v0.2.1)
and vendored at `packages/sdk/src/idl/vsr.json`. That IDL is legacy-anchor
format, incompatible with @coral-xyz/anchor 0.30's `Program`, so
`create_registrar` and `configure_voting_mint` are built manually
(`src/vsr.ts`): sha256("global:<name>")[0..8] discriminators + borsh args,
account lists pinned to the IDL. Layout is asserted byte-level in
`test/governance.test.ts`. On-chain validation lands with the Stage 1
integration suite. Scaled factors use 1e9 == 1.0 (VSR convention).

## D-011 — spl-gov v3 veto semantics verified (2026-06-11)

`GovernanceConfig` in @solana/spl-governance 0.3.28 carries
`councilVetoVoteThreshold` (council vetoes community proposals) and
`communityVetoVoteThreshold` (the reverse). Our modes map to:
council mode -> councilVetoVoteThreshold = YesVotePercentage(vetoPercent);
all other modes -> Disabled (and no council mint exists — structural).
Community veto of council proposals: Disabled (council cannot pass its own
proposals anyway: councilVoteThreshold = Disabled, veto-only council).

## D-012 — Parameters the spec left open, fixed in code (2026-06-11)

- **Voting duration** is absent from the Section 5 tier table. Default
  `baseVotingTime` = 3 days (`DEFAULT_BASE_VOTING_TIME_SECONDS`),
  overridable per launch.
- **Quorum semantics**: spec's `quorumPercent` maps to
  `communityVoteThreshold = YesVotePercentage(quorum)` — i.e. YES votes
  must reach that share of max voter weight (VSR-scaled). This is the
  v3-native reading of "percent of max voter weight".
- **Vote tipping**: community Disabled (full voting window always — the
  cypherpunk "exit window" must never be shortened by early tipping);
  council Strict.
- `votingCoolOffTime` 0 and `depositExemptProposalCount` 0 for MVP.
